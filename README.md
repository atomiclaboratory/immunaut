# Immunaut: Machine Learning-Driven Immunogenicity Analysis

![Immunaut Graphical Abstract](https://github.com/atomiclaboratory/immunaut/blob/master/images/immunaut_abstract.png)

Welcome to the **Immunaut** project! This repository is dedicated to the development of the **Immunaut** platform, which leverages machine learning to perform immunogenicity analysis and vaccine response prediction. The project is organized into multiple directories and files to aid in development and usage.

## R-package Directory

`R-package/`: This directory contains the R package implementation of the **Immunaut** platform. All R functions, libraries, and tools necessary for using the package are found here. Make sure to check the README in the `R-package/` directory for detailed instructions on how to install and use the R package.

## Getting Started

### Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/atomiclaboratory/immunaut.git
```

### Install the Immunaut R package:
Navigate to the R-package/ directory and follow the instructions provided in the README file there.
