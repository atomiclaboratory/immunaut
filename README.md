# 🧑‍🚀🔬 Immunaut: Machine Learning-Driven Immunogenicity Analysis for Precision Vaccinology

![Immunaut Graphical Abstract](https://github.com/atomiclaboratory/immunaut/blob/master/images/immunaut_abstract.png)

Welcome to the **Immunaut** project! 🚀 This platform represents a significant leap forward in our ability to analyze, predict, and optimize vaccine responses across diverse populations. Built as an open-source R package, **Immunaut** combines cutting-edge machine learning with comprehensive immune profiling to identify key biomarkers and map immunophenotypic landscapes that predict vaccine immunogenicity.

## 🔑 Key Features of Immunaut

- **🧬 Multi-Dimensional Immune Data Integration**: Incorporates systemic, mucosal, and cellular immune parameters, enabling holistic evaluation of vaccine-induced responses.
- **⚙️ Advanced Analytical Techniques**: Employs automated dimensionality reduction, clustering, and predictive modeling to reveal robust patterns even in datasets with high interindividual variability.
- **🎯 Precision Vaccinology Framework**: Aligns baseline immune features with post-vaccination outcomes to facilitate tailored immunization strategies, maximizing protection for diverse populations.

## 🧪 Application: Comprehensive Dataset for LAIV Responses

**Immunaut** was applied to one of the most comprehensive datasets for live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) responses to date. The dataset includes:

- **👩‍🔬 Study Cohort**: 244 Gambian children aged 24–59 months enrolled in a phase 4 immunogenicity study ([NCT02972957](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02972957)).
- **📊 Immune Parameters**: Encompasses:
  - **Humoral Responses**: Neutralizing and cross-reactive antibody profiles.
  - **Mucosal Immunity**: IgA responses in nasal mucosa and oral fluids.
  - **Cellular Immunity**: T-cell responses and immunophenotyping.
  - **Transcriptomic Data**: Gene expression in nasal and blood samples.
  - **Microbial and Viral Loads**: Quantification in the respiratory tract.

## **🔍 Key Findings**: Three distinct immunophenotypic responder groups were identified
  1. **CD8 T-Cell Responders**: Primed by extensive pre-existing mucosal immunity.
  2. **Mucosal Responders**: Exhibiting robust IgA-mediated mucosal responses.
  3. **Systemic Responders**: Generating broad systemic humoral immunity.

This dataset integrates pre- and post-vaccination immune data across multiple dimensions, providing unprecedented insights into LAIV-induced immunity.
